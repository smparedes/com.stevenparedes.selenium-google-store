**This is a cucumber jvm selenium sample Project.** 

It contains a sample feature file that adds an item to the cart in the Google store.

After cloning the project, perform the following steps to run the tests:

1. Open terminal or command prompt

2. Change directory "cd" to get to project level folder of "com.stevenparedes.selenium-google-store" 

3. In the command line type: mvn clean install or mvn clean test.

You should see the Chrome browser appear assuming you have the correct chrome driver. 

*Note: Currently, I am running the chromedriver version for Chrome 79.*
