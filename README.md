This is a cucumber jvm selenium sample Project. 
It contains a sample feature file that adds an item to the cart in the Google store.

After cloning the project, perform the following steps to run the tests:

Open terminal or command prompt
Change directory "cd" to get to project level folder of "com.stevenparedes.selenium-google-store" 

In the command line type: mvn clean install or mvn clean test.

You should see the Chrome browser appear assuming you have the right chrome driver. 
Currently I am running the chromedriver version for Chrom 79.
